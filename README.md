## Description
    This single page application serves as a text editor for developers who want to create notes or code snippets. This app can run with or without internet connection. Different data persistence techniques are used so that it may be supported by any browser. The data that is typed into the text editor is also saved into a database using indexDb and npm idb. 

## Installation
Please follow these steps:

### Step 1: 
In your terminal run this command:
```
npm run start
```
This will build the application and run your server.

## Usage
Once your browser opens the app you may begin typing in the text editor.
If you would like to download the app, click the download icon to the right of your search bar. This automatically download with the app and will also carry over all the code you have already written in the browser
